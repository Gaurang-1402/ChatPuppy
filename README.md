# ChatPuppy: Control Robot dog with Natural Language

ChatPuppy is an innovative project that unites Language Logic Models (LLMs) with the control of robot dogs. It enables users to command robot dogs using uncomplicated, everyday language. The project operates on ROS2 (Robot Operating System) Humble and runs simulations in the Gazebo environment, ensuring a reliable and realistic testing platform for robot dog behavior.

Complementing ChatPuppy is a straightforward web application, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to input commands. This melding of leading-edge technology with a user-friendly interface allows controlling robot dogs to be both accessible and intuitive.

While ChatPuppy is currently operating within a simulated environment for comprehensive testing and development, it is also designed for real-world application. This means it has the potential to translate ordinary language into precise commands for actual robot dogs when necessary.

Key features include:
- A user-friendly web application providing an interactive interface for robot puppy control
